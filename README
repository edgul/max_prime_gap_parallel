max prime gap calculator in parallel
************************************

This program uses MPI for process communication to find the largest gap between two consecutive prime numbers within a given range.

build and run:
	make
	mpirun -np 4 ./primegap 2 1000 	(example)
	(where 4 is the number of processes spawned and 2 -> 1000 is the range to search)

output:
	prints rangeProvided, largestPrimeGap, rangeSegmentSize, processingTimes
